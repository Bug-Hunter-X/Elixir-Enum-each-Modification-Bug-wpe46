This example demonstrates a common mistake in Elixir when modifying a list while iterating over it using Enum.each.  The code attempts to remove the element '3' from the list, but due to the immutability of lists in Elixir, the changes aren't reflected in the original list.  The solution shows how to properly handle list modifications during iteration, maintaining immutability.
